# CryptoCompare 🔐

A lightweight cryptographic benchmarking tool designed to evaluate and compare the performance of encryption algorithms such as RSA, ECC, and NTRU.

## 🔍 Overview

This project focuses on:
- Generating and managing cryptographic keys
- Encrypting and decrypting data using different asymmetric algorithms
- Evaluating performance based on key generation time, encryption time, and decryption time
- Comparing results to determine the most efficient algorithm for secure communication on resource-constrained devices

## 📌 Algorithms Used
- RSA
- ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
- NTRU (Lattice-based cryptography)

## RSA(Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman)



## 📈 Output
The system outputs performance metrics and visual comparisons to guide algorithm selection based on use-case and environment.
